title: "Reward driven programmers?"

Why is everyone doing Leetcode? There is obviously something wrong about
the whole tech scene right now(or atleaset the tech people I am exposed to). I am
meeting some pretty smart people, doing leetcode(Not to shit on Leetcode, it's
probably not the worst way to learn to write code, tho computer graphics is soo
much better). 
And more importantly, the endgame for a lot of these people is a job. 
How does that even work for someone
who is a programmer. My end game is to not have a job.

I read [this](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/2G7AH92pHyj3nC32T/inferring-our-desires) recently. 
And looked a little deaper into the overjustification effect. Are we creating
shitty programmers by paying them(us?) more? 

Why are these same people not spending their friday evenings spending writing
fractal visualizations on the weekend? maybe leetcode is a little fun sometimes,
but fractal visualizations are a 100% fun 100% of times.

I had to write this, because maybe someone who's just starting college comes
across and reads this. It is very easy to evade this. Just don't join the kids
getting a 'good player award' ever. A good rule of thumb while writing
anything, try to make it useless. The more useless, the better.

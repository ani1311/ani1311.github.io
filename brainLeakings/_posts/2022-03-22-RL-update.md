## What I understand about RL:

How I think about it is, RL is a graph exploration problem. Here are graph has
two nodes, a state node and an action node. And each state node in the graph is
connected to action nodes, which lead to other state nodes. And when entering
any state node, the agent gets a reward.

The goal of the agent is to figure out which action to take at every state node,
to maximize the reward. The solution to any RL problem is to assign a value to
each state, and action node.

And for a model-free RL problem, the only way an agent interacts with the
environment is, given a state, take some action and recieve some reward.

For a solved RL problem we know the values of each state and action nodes.
Therefore we can deterministically choose the best action for each state node.

We perceive the world using these "brain models". Which helps us map reality wit
h our worldview. But of course, our models have biases and it is super difficult
to see these biases when you are in the first-person view. Because of course th
e way you see things must be how they are. Sometimes, conformational bises almos
t overwhelmingly keep strengthening our models, and one confirmation triumphs li
ke a hundred failures. Until you take a step back are realize the soo obvious in
consistencies. And then you re-tune.

I have (had?) a "Person model" which was pretty simple. The standard social
contract doesn't apply to this "person" model. It's no longer being an a
dversary or a collaborator. I guess the best way to describe it is, it's Hakun
a Matata, cuz you're Timon and they're Pumbaa.
But Timon and Pumbaa break down if Timon's world model for Pumbaa is not the s
ame as Pumbaa's model for Timon. Now, Timon thinks a rationalist and stoic app
roach (at least for now) is the best way to approach difficult situations in lif
e. And it is veryyy difficult for Timon to change Pumbaa's model. But the awes
omeness of Timon and Pumbaa will be overcome by the sourness of their inconsiste
nt models. So the only rational way is for Timon to update his model to get rid
of the biases and to really understand reality and Pumbaa. For this Timon need's
to take a third-person view.

But Timon and Pumbaa are ALWAYS Timon and Pumbaa and it's always hakunamatata.
And Pumba should know that Timon has nothing but love for him. AND IT IS ALWAYS
HAKUNAMATATA.

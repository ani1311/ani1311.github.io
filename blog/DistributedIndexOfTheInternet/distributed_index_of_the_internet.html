                Okay, what is the internet? essentially just a big graph of webpages. So is there be an easy way to
                see the entier internet. Now there are two challenges in this.
                <br>
                <br>

                => Who will run all that compute of crawllers.<br>
                => Where to store graph.

                <br>
                <br>

                <h2> The Idea:</h2>

                A network where each node explores/updates some part of the internet. These nodes run crawllers and
                store the result of these crawllers, i.e some portion of the indexes of the internet on their network
                storage.
                <br>
                Now it is not possible to have the entire index of the internet stored on each node. So we can have a
                merkle tree like structure that each node stores and this structure is updated at each run of the node.

                <br>
                <br>

                <h3> Why do this?</h3>
                Well, for starters, if I want to scrape the web for data, this would be a fantastic resource. But more
                importantly, I don't know how or where someone might come up with an application that uses this API. But
                an index of the Internet sounds like a good resource.

                In addition, if someone can build a good parser, identifier, then this can server as a great tool to
                build new pages. We have hackerNews, but this might help build AritstNews or paleontologistNews.

                I think a publicly available index of the internet opens avenues that we might trancend the current
                internet ecosystem and take us to a new horizon.

                <!-- someone writes a opensource pagerank and uses it on our index to build a search engine. Maybe -->
                <!-- someone -->
                <!-- trains -->
                <!-- GPT4 on the pages of this index. -->

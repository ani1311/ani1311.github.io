                Why isn't the DB of Google public? It is essentially a graph of the internet, with a lot of metadata for
                each page. In other works it is Google's interpretation of the web.
                <br>
                <br>
                The only way for a user to access it is via a small and extremely difficult-to-use API called Google
                search.
                <br>
                <br>
                Imagine you write a book containing all the information of humanity but you keep this book private. The
                only way you can access this book is by asking questions about the book. But you can't actually open a
                page in the book and see for yourself. Isn't that a ridiculously complicated way to read a book? And
                image this book is essentially the one (assumed) source of truth for almost the entire mankind.
                <br>
                <br>
                The obvious solution is just to make the book public. So let's try to make a public graph of the
                internet. This creates an entirely public DB of the internet that is accessible to all. Now anyone with
                the know-how can read the book and critique it.
                <br>
                <br>
                That is my thought behind building a public index of the internet. Now I understand this is no easy
                challenge, but I believe it's a crucial one to make a more public and transparent internet.
                <br>
                <br>
                Now there are two challenges in this.
                <br>
                <br>
                => Who will run all that compute of crawllers.<br>
                => Where to store graph.
                <br>
                <br>
                <h2> The Idea:</h2>

                A network where each node explores/updates some part of the internet. And each node can have a list of
                websites it tracks.<br>
                These nodes run crawllers and store the result of these crawllers.
                <br>
                <br>
                <h2> How?</h2>

                <h3> The Crawller:</h3>
                This is the main compute that will run on each node.
                <br>
                <a href="https://github.com/ani1311/Spider">Spider in golang</a>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h3> The Database</h3>
                What we need to store. Consider that there is a node that is the root of each domain. Now this root will
                have a tree of all the pages in that domain. But any node in this tree may also be refered by a node in
                some other tree outside the domain. This way, the web forms a graph, and we need a structure to store
                this graph.

                A complete index of the internet containing links to the pages of most(Possibly every website) will have
                a size in the order of terabytes. This can not be feasible stored in every node. We need the data base
                to have the following properties:<br>
                -> It must be mutable by any node in the network.

                <br>
                <br>

                We can use <a href="https://ipfs.io/">IPFS</a> to store the base DB. This distributes the data over
                multiple IPFS nodes ensuring the
                integrity of the entire store.
                <br>


                <br>
                <br>

                <h2> Who will run these nodes?</h2>
                If I want my website to be in the index, I will somehow run the node, either by paying or running my own
                node(TBD)

There is obviously something wrong about
the whole tech scene right now(or atleaset the tech people I am exposed to). I am
meeting some pretty smart people, doing leetcode(Not to shit on Leetcode, it’s
probably not the worst way to learn to write code, tho computer graphics is soo
much better). 
And more importantly, the endgame for a lot of these people is a job. 
How does that even work for someone
who is a programmer. My end game is to not have a job.</p>

<p>I read <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/2G7AH92pHyj3nC32T/inferring-our-desires">this</a> recently. 
And looked a little deaper into the overjustification effect. Are we creating
shitty programmers by paying them(us?) more?</p>

<p>Why are these same people not spending their friday evenings spending writing
fractal visualizations on the weekend? maybe leetcode is a little fun sometimes,
but fractal visualizations are a 100% fun 100% of times.</p>

<p>I had to write this, because maybe someone who’s just starting college comes
across and reads this. It is very easy to evade this. Just don’t join the kids
getting a ‘good player award’ ever. A good rule of thumb while writing
anything, try to make it useless. The more useless, the better.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Why is everyone doing Leetcode?

<p>How I think about it is, RL is a graph exploration problem. Here are graph has
two nodes, a state node and an action node. And each state node in the graph is
connected to action nodes, which lead to other state nodes. And when entering
any state node, the agent gets a reward.</p>

<p>The goal of the agent is to figure out which action to take at every state node,
to maximize the reward. The solution to any RL problem is to assign a value to
each state, and action node.</p>

<p>And for a model-free RL problem, the only way an agent interacts with the
environment is, given a state, take some action and recieve some reward.</p>

<p>For a solved RL problem we know the values of each state and action nodes.
Therefore we can deterministically choose the best action for each state node.</p>
